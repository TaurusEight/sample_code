Stored procedures written for MariaDB (MySQL).
Written by Daniel Mendyke for http://www.mikesnewsletters.com

Makes use of the M4 preprocessor in order to allow macros and variable type
short cuts. Â Requires a 'make' process to load into the actual database.

The design philosophy is to move as much actual processing into the database
engine as possible in order to reduce the amount of higher level code (Python,
JavaScript) required.

See '.sql' files for details and comments on use.
